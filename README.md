##Bringing back Myspace
Sometimes I get nostalgic for days past. I kind of miss the days when social media wasn’t plagued by angry trolls, Russian bots, and like-thirsty friends. Myspace was a digital wild west where none of that mattered. It was a time when all we worried about were scary chain bulletins and who was on our top 8.

I was inspired to reimagine my portfolio as a Myspace page. I designed the page by using [Tom’s iconic page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080719113317/https://myspace.com/tom) from 2008 as a reference and rebuilt it from scratch using React. Everything is here: odd color choices, top 8 friends, and a wall of comments living in all its web 2.0 glory.
